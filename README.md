> [!WARNING]
> This plugin is Work in Progress.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of May 2025, It is in full rework/rewrite state: Hyland Content Intelligence has evolved, more APIs are available, usage has changed, etc.
> 
> So, please, **do not use it as is**, it will not work. For now, using GitHub more as as backup than a pre-release work :-)
